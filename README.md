# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions

Tech Stack: Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn

📌 Overview

This project explores machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset (284,807 records, ~0.17% fraud). The goal was to identify anomalies accurately while minimizing false positives — a common challenge in fraud detection systems.

⚙️ Approach

Conducted data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to understand transaction behavior and class imbalance.

Implemented and compared Gaussian Mixture, PCA, Isolation Forest, and Random Forest (balanced weights) models for anomaly detection.

Applied feature scaling and model evaluation using ROC-AUC and precision-recall metrics to measure performance.

📊 Results

Isolation Forest delivered the best trade-off between recall and precision, effectively identifying rare fraudulent cases.

Visualized transaction patterns and detection performance with Matplotlib and Seaborn for interpretability.

💡 Key Takeaways

Strengthened skills in anomaly detection, model evaluation, and imbalanced data handling.

Demonstrated ability to translate analytical results into actionable business insights — relevant to fraud detection and community analytics domains.
